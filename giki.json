CyS has had widespread applications in all types of products – it is now central in each product we use, ranging from phones to manufacturing to flight safety to air conditioners and fridges to cars. In short, CyS is not only playing a significant role in changing our lives for good but is also shaping the economies of many countries. The honorable president of Pakistan, Dr. Arif-ur-Rehman Alvi, through his initiative (Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing – PIAIC) and Government of Pakistan, led by Mr. Imran Khan, have continuously urged and encouraged higher education institutes to take up emerging fields like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Cyber Security and Block Chain at undergraduate and diploma level. Thus, Cyber Security will hopefully play a vital role in the economy of Pakistan and is projected to become a multi-billion industry in the near future.",

        "program_description": "Rapid commercialization of conventional and modern, man-made products gave birth to process industry. The dynamics of the industry requires group of highly trained professionals from almost all engineering disciplines. However chemical engineer organizes his/her coordination at the process plant and thus deemed as process brain. Such responsibility demands basic knowledge of all conventional trades of engineering in addition to in-depth knowledge of large-scale industrial dynamics. Continuous and safe process operation is an exclusive responsibility of this trade, in addition to design, problem investigation and troubleshooting. Well-versed chemical engineer, during his/her career, usually encounters a diverse field of application in thermodynamics dictating unit processes.",
