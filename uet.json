The program provides a broad engineering core competence which enables students to communicate & interact effectively with engineers in different areas of specialization & to make technological decisions with confidence. On successful completion, the student possesses the ability to perform integrated problems solving ability, problem identification, analysis, hypothesis testing, solution verification, and its implementation. Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) at appropriate Bloom’s taxonomy level in the three learning domains, namely, Cognitive, Psychomotor and Affective have been developed in accordance with Outcome Based Education. These CLOs are linked with twelve graduate attributes that Department of Electrical Engineering has adopted from Washington Accord/PEC. All the assessments are linked with course learning outcomes. Final Year Projects and Lab experiments etc are marked according to developed scoring rubrics. Problem and activity-based learning is strongly encouraged and students are also prepared for Complex Engineering Problems",
