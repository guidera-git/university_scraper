    "introduction": "Established in Lahore in 1882, the University of  Punjab is the largest and the oldest seat of higher learning in Pakistan. It  was the first to be established in the sub-continent in a Muslim majority area. Located in the historical and culturally alive city of  Lahore, this university has played a leading role in spreading higher education  in the country. The University strives to provide a conducive environment for  the pursuit of academic activities. On account of its highly qualified and internationalized  faculty, pleasant environment, and low tuition fees, the university remains the  institution of the first choice for students. The University comprises six campuses, 19 Faculties, 08  Constituent Colleges, and 138 departments, centers, and institutes. The  University also has 658 affiliated colleges. It has 991 full-time/regular and  300 part-time faculty members involved in teaching/research and 50,000+ on-campus students. (42,700+ BS Hons, 5,800+ M.Phil. and 1,500+ Ph.D. students). Allama Iqbal Campus, named after the great South Asian  thinker and poet-philosopher. Its Indo-Islamic architecture houses Colleges of Art  and Design, IT and Pharamacy along with the most historic Oriental College, the  first avatar of the University which was established in 1870. It is located on  the Mall Road of Lahore. Quaid-e-Azam Campus, located in an area spread over  1800 acres of lush green landscape, was designed by the renowned Greek  Architect A.C. Doxiadis who also designed Islamabad. This campus is the center  of academic and administrative activities of the university. A canal dividing  the academic blocks from the student lodgings adds to the beauty of the Campus. The University also has a summer campus at Khanaspur  located at a height of about 7,000 feet in the Himalayan range near Ayubia.  This campus, in addition to providing research facilities, is also used as a  recreational center for the faculty and the students.",
